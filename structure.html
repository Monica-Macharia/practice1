        <p id="para1">Remember: especially if you're having a nontraditional wedding, your nontraditional wedding </br>invitation's wording needs to focus on minimizing confusion… because you're going to be </br>maximizing disorientation. I vote for straightforward wording,with maybe one little piece</br>  of flair tossed in. Your wedding might confuse more traditional guests — don't let</br>  your invitation wording be confusing too!</p>
